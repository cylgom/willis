Willis is a lightweight input library for keyboard, mouse and touchscreen events.
It was designed to communicate directly with display systems whithout relying on
a particular windowing library or widget toolkit.
Its flexibility makes Willis perfectly suited for use with custom windowing code
or low-abstraction libraries like [globox](https://github.com/cylgom/globox).

## Warning
Work-in-progress!

## Example
An integration example is provided in [globox](https://github.com/cylgom/globox).

## Additional Information
The name "Willis" is that of a character from the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie.
